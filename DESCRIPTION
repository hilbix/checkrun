Program watchdog to terminate a program with starving output

Checkrun runs a program and checks, if it did some output within a
given time interval.  If no output can be detected, the child will be
terminated, first with a HUP, then a TERM and afterwards a KILL.

In a distant future all this functionality here might be implemented
into my "timeout" tool as well, however I needed this feature before
timeout had this feature.  If you need to test a pipe for silence, use
/bin/cat as program, or try the "timeout" tool.
